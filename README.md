# rise-up
As a Person I want to feel good about the person I am.
As a Person I want to be able to express my own self love.
As a Person I want to not feel ashamed of myself for learning at my speed, having my face, having my body, having my own feelings.

# positive self-awareness modal/daily aphermations:
This web api. will have a large header
followed by two modals.
It will have a total of two containers with two different web.apis that will  be have prompts that say either enter a mood / enter Yes man and get a random activity.
the user will input:"what kind of mood they are in", or "yes man" and the api will return a positive aphermation to help get you through your day / or offer you a list of random activities that might help you get out of your daily funk- be a yes man!
